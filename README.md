# osh: The Open Shell

osh is a rudimentary shell written in C. It adapts much of its base code from Stephen Brennan's [tutorial](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/), from which their code's repository can be found. I followed the tutorial to build a basic shell and gain an understanding of how shell's work in *nix systems. I am building on the base shell by adding a multitude of features, such as:
* Piping (|)
* Redirection (< or >)
* Parallel execution (```mkdir foo && cd foo```, multithreading)
* More to come
